Python 3.7 or higher
sklearn for machine learning models
pandas for data manipulation
numpy for numerical operations

Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourprojectname.git
cd yourprojectname
Step 2: Create a virtual environment 
It's a good practice to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies:

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
On MacOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Step 3: Install dependencies
Install all required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 4: Run the code
After installing the dependencies and ensuring the data is correctly placed, run the Python script as follows:
python stock_analysis.py

Step 6: Evaluate the model
The script will run and print the accuracy score of the model.
Accuracy: 0.9976
